### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software architect (specializing in front-end technologies, React, Webpack, NodeJS).
Love to do magic by solving hard problems using elegant solutions.

See my projects (which I'm very proud of):

- https://devek.app - Developer Kit - Everything a developer needs in a single place (All client-side, no server)
